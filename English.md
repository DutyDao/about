# DUTYDAO

### Abstract:
  The blockchain has grown by leaps and bounds in recent years, more and more people can be enjoyed in the DeFi (Decentralized Finance), but the basic core of DeFi still relies on the traditional centralized system to implement stable coins, and there are various risks of centralization. It may be because of an administrative order that assets will be destroyed or frozen. At the same time, people in many developing countries around the world do not have their own bank accounts, or suffer from inflation.

  In the past few years, there have been many decentralized computing projects, some have achieved great success, but there have also been huge failures. Luna's UST token developed to a huge market cap, and then collapsed in 2 days.  Makerdao's DAI token has developed steadily for a long time, but the value growth of MKR is not as high as that of Luna. People in developing countries do not have their own bank accounts or suffer from inflation.

  For an algorithmic stable coin protocol, the market value cannot be blindly pursued. All stable coins are the debt of the protocol. Blind expansion will bring about a run impact in the economic downturn. The underlying assets of the algorithmic stable coin protocol must be dominated by assets with high liquidity, plus some emerging assets, the proportion of emerging assets should be within 20%, to ensure that in the worst case, it can be guaranteed that it will not break off. Value growth is not as high as Luna. People in developing countries do not have their own bank accounts or suffer from inflation.

  The protocol needs to have a debt ceiling control, set the debt ceiling within a safe range according to the stable coin circulation, collateral, and mintage, and adjust it in time according to the situation to avoid the impact of the external market leading to de-anchoring. When setting the debt ceiling, it is necessary to consider the impact of short-term extreme markets and possible impact on stable coins, retain a large safety margin, and carry out emergency maintenance in the event of a black swan event.

  The protocol governance mechanism must have a practical role, governance token holders have the right to participate in the protocol governance, and the value of the governance token is positively related to the value of the protocol, with equal rights and obligations. Holding assets without having power means not holding assets. Hold governance tokens and enjoy governance rights. At the same time, governance tokens are bound to the protocol, and the protocol is easier to move in the right direction and will not be rash.

  The stabilization agreement mechanism is essentially a balance of power and obligations. If you only enjoy printing money, but do not bear debts, there will inevitably be over-issued currency, which will lead to de-anchoring. For a good calculation and stability agreement, money printing and debt repayment must be integrated. Whoever prints money pays the bill and ensures the repayment of debt can ensure stability.

  DutyDao will be based on the over-collateralization mechanism and the destruction and minting, minting algorithmic stablecoins benchmarked against the US dollar, and promote it in various public chains, cooperate with various protocols, and widely participate in the defi ecology, especially for decentralized transactions. Place. At the same time, DutyDao will also carry out offline promotion to help more ordinary people without bank accounts to have their own on-chain accounts. The governance token of DutyDao manages various parameters of the computing stability protocol, and at the same time, it continues to develop and iteratively introduce new modules to establish a more stable computing stability system.

###  Algorithmic Stablecoin Core Mechanism:

  Dusd will be minted in several ways, reducing overall market risk. The first is the mortgage casting by usdt to ensure absolute stability in the initial stage and build trust. The second is over-collateralized casting, which is performed by using assets like ETH and WBTC for over-collateralized casting. The third stage is the over-collateralization of governance tokens, which empowers governance tokens. The fourth stage is to lock and cast, and use some high-quality assets to directly exchange with the agreement. The agreement obtains high-quality assets and then casts Dusd. However, the overall debt scale of this type of casting will be strictly controlled to reduce the probability of systemic risk. Several casting methods have higher risks in sequence, but the higher-risk mechanism will have more growth potential. When setting the upper limit of the debt scale, stricter scale control is carried out on the high-risk casting to ensure that it will not break away under any circumstances. anchor. DutyDao will use the treasury assets and the resources of the community to invest in and incubate some projects to increase the ecology of the use of Dusd, and these investments will earn more income for the treasury. Dusd will adopt modular development, and modules such as casting, risk control, and stability can be independently developed and connected, and can also be replaced and upgraded, while leaving room for later expansion.

###  The way  to keep Dusd stable:
  
  Dusd was initially minted by Usdt and similar fiat-collateralized stablecoins, and then over-collateralized minting was introduced to maintain sufficient debt repayment capacity at any time. At the same time, PSM (Peg Stability Module) will provide a 1:1 ratio between Dusd and Usdt. Fixed exchange rate swaps. When the PSM reserve is exhausted (more than 80% of the circulation) and Dusd begins to de-anchor slightly, there will be arbitrageurs who will carry out redemption arbitrage to keep Dusd anchored.
  
### It can be used in the following scenarios:
 
  1. Do more leverage. If you are more optimistic about the assets you hold, you can use this asset to mortgage Dusd and buy more of this asset. After the asset appreciates, you can get greater returns. 
  
  2. Earn protocol income, you can deposit Dusd into the protocol and enjoy the protocol income. 
  
  3. For value transfer between multiple chains, Dusd will be deployed on multiple chains (minting is only in Eth). 
 
   4. Cross-border transfers.

###  How to participate in the protocol governance of DutyDao?

It is still in the early stage of protocol development, mainly through community communication, GitHub issues, and airdrop governance tokens in the later stage. Then, governance tokens are used for protocol governance to control various parameters of the protocol, and develop while ensuring the stability of the protocol.


###   The meaning of Protocol Governance:

The collapse of luna has a great relationship with Ust's excessive debt scale. If there is a community agreement governance, the community will definitely pay attention to the potential risk of excessive debt scale. At the same time, in the process of community agreement governance, there will be discussions with different opinions, and various potential problems of each plan and each decision will be more fully exposed.

### Ecological investment:
 
 Various defi protocols and applications, most of which use fiat currency to mortgage stable coins, can promote the use of Dusd through various operational/commercial cooperation, and can also directly create scenarios using Dusd in the form of direct investment and incubation. DutyDao takes advantage of the community, selects high-quality projects for investment incubation, and provides various support, high-quality projects grow, at the same time DutyDao gets financial returns, and Dusd has more applications.
